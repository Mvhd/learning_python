#When a number is large, itâ€™ll become difficult to read. For example:
count1 = 10000000000
# To make the long numbers more readable, you can group digits using underscores, like this:
count2 = 10_000_000_000
# When storing these values, Python just ignores the underscores. It does so when displaying the numbers with underscores on the screen:
print(count2)
